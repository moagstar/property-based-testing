#   What about performing the same operation 3 times in a row? Or passing different values
#   to the various arguments these operations take? As we can see, in even
#   the simplest of systems the number of test cases for a brute force method
#   is unmanageable. There must be a better way.
#
#   Of course not all permutations are valid, for example we don't want a test case of the
#   form ``put``, ``get``, ``new``, ``size`` - it doesn't make sense to do perform any of
#   the other operations on a queue until after it is created. What we need is a way to
#   specify the valid operations for the system under test.
#   In hypothesis we can derive a class from RuleBasedStateMachine where methods decorated
#   with @rule are treated as states in the system. The @rule decorator is a bit like the
#   @given decorator, defining the strategies to use for generating argument values. However
#   @rule is only allowed in the context of a RuleBasedStateMachine.
#   All transitions between states are assumed valid, but the @precondition decorator can be
#   used on a method to indicate whether a transition to this state is valid or not. In this
#   way we can build a specification for the system under test.
#
#   Using the Queue example, this is how the specification would look. To create
#   a new queue we have the precondition that the queue must not already be
#   created. For all other operations we check the precondition that the queue
#   must have been created. And to get an item from the queue, we want to check
#   that the queue is not empty.

#   Besides specifying the various states and valid transitions, we want these
#   methods to actually invoke the operation it represents on the system under
#   test, but also we want to have a model which represents our system under
#   test, and perform some similar operation on the model as well. We can then
#   assert post conditions comparing the model and the system under test to
#   determine if we got the expected behaviour or not. Of course you don't have
#   to use a model, you can assert other properties about the system under test
#   using this method.
#
#   So in our queue example we can use a list as our model.

#   RuleBasedStateMachine exposes a TestCase class which can be used like the
#   standard TestCase classes.
#
#   Let's run some tests.
#
#   As you can see we got some failures, let's have a look at the error, it appears
#   we created a new queue of size 2, we put a 0 into it, then put a 1 into it, and
#   the performed a get. If we look at the assertion failure, we see that by the get
#   our system under test gave us a 0, while the model gave us a 1. Now this is a
#   FIFO queue, which is the behaviour we see from the actual system under test. We
#   have here a bug in our model, our model is insufficient to represent the system
#   under test. Luckily we can fix that by changing the append to a prepend in the
#   put state.

#   This time we encounter a different error. We create a new queue of size 1, we
#   put a 0 into it, then put another 0 into it, and then ask for the size. Our
#   actual system under test reports 0, while the model reports 2. Now the 0 is
#   clearly wrong, but what is going on here? Well I create a queue of size 1
#   and then I put 2 items into it. It's debatable about what the system should
#   actually do here, maybe raise an exception, but for the sake of the tests
#   we generated an invalid test case here, so this is a bug in our specification.
#   We can fix this by altering the pre condition to ensure we don't try and put
#   items on the queue if it is already full.

#   Now we get yet another error, this time with create a new queue of size 1, we put
#   an item into it and we ask the size. Our model gives the correct answer, 1,
#   but our actual system under test gives a size of 0, that's clearly wrong, I
#   think this is a bug in the actual implementation of the system under test. Let's
#   take a look at what is going here.
